# Clippy configuration for code quality checks
# See https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html for all options
#
# Note: This file is for configuring Clippy's behavior, not for enabling/disabling lints.
# To enable/disable specific lints, use attributes in code or configure them in Cargo.toml

# Example valid configuration options (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# msrv = "1.70"
# too-many-arguments-threshold = 7
# too-many-lines-threshold = 1000
# cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30
